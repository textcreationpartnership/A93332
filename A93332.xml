            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>at what I have holden forth with the right hand, ſome
<pb facs="tcp:172714:6"/> have thought fit to receive with the left. Of which number, one <hi>F. H.</hi> (who is to me ſo meer a ſtranger, that ſo far as I know, we have never ſeen one anothers face) is one, who in a pretended confutation of a Sermon Preached by me <hi>Auguſt 17. 1664.</hi> at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> out of a miſtaken zeale to his own cauſe, contrary to mine inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then—<hi>expreſſed profeſſion,</hi> tells the world in Print, <hi>That I, and ſuch as I, have by ſuch Publique Diſcourſes as that of mine, blowne the ſparkes, and kindled a flame in the Rulers, and incenſed them, and ſtirred them up to ſeverity and harſhneſſe againſt them who feare the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> (pag. 11.) And leſt the Reader ſhould faile to take notice thereof, he ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe in divers other places of his book. But this wight perhaps fall out accidentally, and beyond his purpoſe: And therefore his words (pag. 5.) are more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsive, that his meaning was, that
<pb facs="tcp:172714:6"/> my very end in Preaching and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Sermon, was <hi>to ſtir up per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt them.</hi> I had ſaid to this purpoſe in my Sermon Sect. 2. That were it granted, that Chriſt had forbidden all Swearing, <hi>We ſhould be neceſſitated to diſobey the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Legall commands.</hi> The Reaſon is, becauſe we muſt obey God rather then man, and conſequently not act by an humane precept what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by a divine. And the truth of that propoſition is evident, and undeniable: For that is a Legall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which is a command according to Law: So the Magiſtrates impoſing an Oath in many Caſes is a Legall command; yet were it not to be obeyed, had our Saviour countermanded all Swearing. So what I ſaid is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively true; and yet <hi>F. H.</hi> avers the contrary, and ſayes (pag. 4.) <hi>That there is no neceſſity to indge, that he that feares</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid veſuſes, or els he ſpeaks nothing to
<pb facs="tcp:172714:7"/> the purpoſe) <hi>to Sweare</hi>—does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſobey the <hi>Magiſtrates Legall command:</hi> which Aſſertion is falſe, and contradictive of it ſelfe. The Magiſtrate Legally (that is by Law) commands <hi>F. H.</hi> to Sweare; <hi>F. H.</hi> will not, does not: <hi>F. H.</hi> there diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys the Magiſtrates Legall commands, <hi>Yet theſe</hi> (ſayes he, pag 5.) <hi>are but the ſecret ſmitings and ſuggeſtions of</hi> A. S. <hi>to render them odious to the Magiſtrates, and all people, who diſſent from him in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Is not this a ſtrange man, that will take upon him to judge of, and diſcover the thoughts of another mans heart, as though he knew them better than himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this is a ſubtility, which tends viſibly to begit in his brethren a diſſafection to me, as though what I ſaid to reclaime them, ſprung rather out of hatred to their Perſons, than love to their ſoules; which falſe conceit once rooted in them, may create in them a prejudice againſt what ever
<pb facs="tcp:172714:7"/> they finde in my Writings, by which, in that caſe, they are like to receive no advantage; either out of neglect to reade them, or in reading them with neglect.</p>
            <p>Another like Artifice <hi>F. H.</hi> makes<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> great uſe of, and that is, to make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleeve that I am a time-ſerver, and ſuch an one as makes no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of what I ſay or doe, provided it tends to mine own advantage, and ſo there need no great regard be had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to what I Preach, or Print. To which purpoſe he ſpeaks in the firſt page of his Epiſtle in theſe words; A. S. <hi>hath ſought to make voyd Chriſts command, for to obey the command of men.</hi> And in the third page of his book, he breaks out into this expoſtulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>What would not this man encounter with? or what would not he oppoſe, if he have but the power of this world on his ſide?</hi> And againe (pag. 32) he ſpeaks of <hi>A. S.</hi> and ſuch as he, <hi>who ſaile with
<pb facs="tcp:172714:8"/> Wind and Tide, and exalt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud that which hath prayſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, and hath not the prayſe of God.</hi> On the contrary, he ſtiles himſelfe in his Frontiſpeece, <hi>A ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer for Chriſt, and his Doctrine;</hi> and thoſe of his own party, the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> (pag. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to prevent the miſunderſtanding of well-meaning people, let me for a little <hi>ſpeak fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly</hi> (as the Apoſtle words it) in mine own vindication.

If this be done out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ (as I am very apt to believe) he is indeed to be pittied for his ignorance, but juſtly to be blamed for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that he would take upon him to Write he knew not what, and anſwer what he does not underſtand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (being blinde himſelfe) to leade others into the ditch. I doe much pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his ignorance, conceiving him to be one that meanes well, and ſtrongly conceited that he is in the Truth, as having pinned his faith upon <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:172714:13"/> of that, as <hi>F.

For, if Gods minde were once that people ſhould

And if his minde be ſtill that people ſhould Swear, then cannot Chriſts minde be that people ſhould not Swear, unleſs God and Chriſt be contrary minded, and then they are not the ſame God. And if Chriſts minde cannot be that the people ſhall not Swear, then his minde is that the people

Then he ſeems to be offended with thoſe <hi>that diſpute about the plain words of Scripture,</hi> though as plaine as they be, he cannot make ſenſe of them, if meant as he would have them.

And are there not amongſt our ſelves too many that doe the ſame? And if theſe two comprehend all others, why did Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately mention <hi>two</hi> more, <hi>Jeruſalem, and the head?</hi> He ſaies again, and again, <hi>That by Heaven, and Earth, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, are more ample, and more large</hi> (he ſhould have

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:172714:49"/> of his Opinion ſay, that they (in this ſenſe) are very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the preceding words, <hi>ve. 33. It hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt performe unto the Lord thine Oaths. But I ſay unto you,</hi> (who as <hi>F.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172714:50"/> of the Law, contrary to his own expreſs profeſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. That the Goſpel is not conſonant, but repugnant to the Law, &amp;c. Theſe and the like inconveniencies doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that Interpretation of the words (from whence all theſe follow) to be falſe. And therefore ſome other is to be found out to cleare our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that we be not ſplit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Rocks.

               <hi>Swearing by God,</hi> and no <hi>other.

In oppoſition to which deluding Doctrine and couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning practices, our Saviour prohibits all ſuch abuſed Oaths, and gives this Reaſon thereof, That the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were miſtaken in ſaying, that ſuch Oaths were not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe God was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely therein named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe even thoſe, <hi>by Heaven, Earth, &amp;c.</hi> have a conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall atteſtation of God in reſpect of the neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

However, a Generall Council (though not free from all poſſibility of errour) is the higheſt, and moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Judicature for matters of Religion in the World, and therefore ſhould not have been ſo ſlighted by <hi>F.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> The fifth <hi>Argument in forme</hi> is this, Nothing that is not of it ſelfe, and intrinſecally evill, is forbidden by Chriſt. (And that is proved by Induction.) But Swearing is not of it ſelfe, and intrin-ſecally evill; for the beſt Creatures, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and holy Men, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, and Apoſtles, yea Chriſt himſelfe, and God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, did Swear upon occaſion. And therefore Chriſt did not forbid it. With this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>F. H.</hi> ſeems to be much troubled: For he ſpends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five whole leaves in his attempt to anſwer it. And he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:172714:63"/> begins with asking Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Whereto I anſwer, That it was not evill for a <hi>Jew</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law (as an executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of Juſtice) to ſmite out an Eye, or Tooth, or cut off Hand, or Foot, or Wound. Nor was it evill to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to that purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo appointed in the Judiciall Law, <hi>Ex. 21. 24. Lev. 24. 19, 20. Deut.</hi> 19. 21. Nor was it, nor is it evill for a man to ſeek the defence of his Rights by juſt means. Yet from all theſe Conceſſions, <hi>A. Ss.</hi> Argument cannot be anſwered. For that of our Saviour, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 39, 40. was ſpoken to his Diſciples, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:172714:64"/> the people (St. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 20. &amp; 7. 1.) but the Law, <hi>Eye for Eye, Deut.</hi> 19. 21. was given to the Magiſtrates, <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. and the execution thereof not permitted to the people, but by the Magiſtrates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 18. unleſs (as ſome think) in capital crimes. If it be objected, that then our Saviours words are not oppoſed to the Law, as it ſeems they ſhould by theſe words, <hi>But I ſay unto you,</hi> I grant that to be true. For they indeed ſtand in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, but to the peoples depraved cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome allowed by the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> who being irritated by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:172714:64"/> ſome injury, were often ſuch carvers of their own ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that they cut out ſo large retaliations, that at length their adverſaries were no leſs wronged, then they had formerly been injured by them, which was an occaſion to make their quarrells, and enmity perpetuall. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the holy Jeſus thought fit to prohibit that practice, ariſing not ſo much out of the love of Juſtice, as out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice towards them by whom they had been grieved. Here then is not any thing forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that was commanded before, or what in it ſelfe was good or lawfull; but what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:172714:65"/> was evill in it ſelfe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo acknowledged, as malice, and deſire of revenge. So the whole purport of Chriſts words was, That men ſhould neither wiſh any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, nor out of any heat of anger, or rage, contrive, or act any harme to thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who before had done ſomewhat to their prejudice. Which notwithſtanding, it was lawful to bring offenders before the Magiſirates, that they might be corrected, and thereby learn to amend their lives, and abſtaine for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the like injuries, or that others by their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might learn to beware,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:172714:65"/> and not run into ſuch exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; or that they (the wronged parties) and others, might afterwards live in greater ſecurity, without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or oppreſſion; or (if the grievances were of that Nature) to recover their own, or receive a juſt <hi>compenſation.</hi> Selfe defence then, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in a moderate way, is not diſallowed; but ſuch a <hi>reſiſtance of Will</hi> onely, as ariſes out of hatred, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge. So the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> a Star of the firſt magnitude in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horizen expounds <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Truth</hi> is, that that late eloquent Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> did merit well of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but (as his Genius led him) was more prone to make uſe of the palme of Rhetorique, than of the fiſt of Logique,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:172714:88"/> and was willing by endearing expreſſions, and all poſſible condeſcentions to gaine the affections of his Adverſaries, (which Method, ſome great and good perſons have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; but, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable diſpoſition of thoſe they dealt with, not often with good ſucceſs) for which civility, he had a very unhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome returne given him by the ſcur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>F.

But <hi>F. H.</hi> has yet a further Reply, and that is, <hi>That I ſtand upon the Morality of the third Command, I much forget my ſelfe.</hi> And his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe <hi>all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the firſt Table, are not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:172714:89"/> Morall.</hi> And then he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the confeſſed Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niality of ſomewhat in the fourth Command, to wit, in the deſignation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day; and profeſſes, <hi>we uſed to call it</hi> (that is, the fourth) <hi>as Morall as the third,</hi> which if he meane of every particular therein ſpecified, is a groſs, and notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. But let him not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake himſelfe in thinking to eſcape ſo. For either the third Command which is no more dut this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of God in vain</hi>) is <hi>Morall,</hi> or it is not. If it be, then Chriſt has neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, nor ought that is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:172714:89"/> conſequent therein; and ſo my Argument holds good, notwithſtanding his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Anſwers. But if it be not <hi>Morall,</hi> but <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> (Ceremonies being now anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated in the time of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>) then we may now law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and without ſin, <hi>take the Name of God in vain,</hi> which is impious to aſſert. From which <hi>F.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:172714:90"/> deſtroys what formerly he had built, and grants his own Tenet to be falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> But <hi>F. H.</hi> ſayes, <hi>He cannot own Swearing in that Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way as the Iews did uſe it.</hi> It would perhaps puzzle him to tell us of any one Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that was by the <hi>Jews</hi> inſeparably annexed to the taking of an Oath. How ever the Queſtion now betwixt us is not, whether any Ceremonies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be lawfull, or unlawfull; but whether Swearing it ſelfe be ſo, or no. And his ſaying, <hi>That he cannot own it in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:172714:90"/> Jewiſh Ceremonious way</hi> might put one in hope, that he meant not to refuſe it, if tendred ſimply after the manner of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> The eighth Argument was, <hi>That Chriſt never did any thing without Reaſon.</hi> But there was no Reaſon why he ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forbid <hi>Swearing;</hi> and therefore he did not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it. To this <hi>F. H.</hi> replies, (granting that our Saviour did never any thing without Reaſon) <hi>That he denyes the Concluſion.</hi> Indeed he has all this time hitherto done ſo: but here he means <hi>better than</hi> he ſpeaks. For he produces ſix
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:172714:91"/> Reaſons why Chriſt ſhould forbid all manner of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To recite them, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them. They are theſe: The firſt is, <hi>There was a time before the fall, when there was no Oath, nor any neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for unbeliefe, or ſin, had not yet entred.</hi> And therefore Chriſt had Reaſon to forbid Oaths when ſin and unbelief were entred into the world, and conſequently, <hi>when</hi> there was a great uſe, if not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of them. Is not this a rationall conſequence?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> His ſecond Reaſon is this, <hi>Chriſt is the Mediator of the everlaſting Covenant, yea the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:172714:91"/> Covenant it ſelfe,</hi> (if ſo, he is the Mediator of himſelfe) <hi>and is made a propitiation for ſin, and tranſgreſſion, to end both ſin, tranſgreſſion, and unbeliefe,</hi> and therefore Chriſt forbad Swearing, which is not uſeful where there is neither ſin, tranſgreſſion, nor unbeliefe. I grant that Chriſt came to aboliſh ſin, which were it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, there would be no need of Oaths. But let <hi>F. H.</hi> himſelfe be judge, whether ſin does not ſtill abound in the world. If it doe not, he has no cauſe for his tragicall complaint <hi>of the ſad times, and how they that depart from</hi>

So this Reaſon is not for <hi>F. H.</hi> but againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> His third is, <hi>That after ſin was entred, and death by ſin—ſuch was Gods love to mankind, that for confirmation of his Word, he ſwore by himſelfe, which was not exemplary for
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:172714:92"/> Chriſtians truely ſuch.</hi> What then? this undoubtedly proves that ſome Swearing is good, for God ſwore, and yet he never did any thing but what was good. But Gods Swearing (be it exemplary to Chriſtians, or no) is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Chriſt ſhould forbid men to Swear, who thereby might rather be warranted thereto. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> wrought Miracles; theſe acts are not exemplary to us: and yet, that was no Reaſon why he ſhould forbid his Apoſtles, and ſuch as he had endowed with that ſupernatural power to work them. But this is not all: For <hi>F. H.</hi> addes, <hi>That our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:172714:93"/> Saviour prohibited that,</hi> Mat. 5. 34. <hi>which ſometimes was commanded, and yet be did not deſtroy the Law, and command for Oaths.</hi> If this be true, then <hi>God</hi> once commanded Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and that <hi>command was added</hi> (ſayes <hi>F. H.</hi>) becauſe of <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi>) and that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, viz. <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, and Chriſt did not abrogate that Law, (and therefore it ſtill continues in force) and yet did enact ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flatly repugnant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. God commanded Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt diſanulls not that command; yet prohibits by his Law all Swearing. So we have two Laws (according to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:172714:93"/> 
               <hi>F. H.</hi>) both in force, whereof one is diametrically contrary to the other, to both whereof Obedience is impoſſible, in reſpect that if we performe the one, we muſt of neceſſity violate the other, which is ſuch a Doctrine, as to me ſeems worſe than <hi>Manicheiſme.</hi> For I ſhould eaſilyer believe there were two ſeveral Gods, one repugnant to the other, than that the Father, and the Son, to wit, one and the ſame God ſhould thwart himſelfe by promulgating contrary Laws.

And therefore that <hi>Swearing</hi> that was commanded, was onely when there was ſome juſt and weighty occaſion to take an Oath, which was to be not inconſiderately, but adviſedly done. And then
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:172714:96"/> ſure the Name of the Lord might with as much facility be uſed, as that of <hi>Baal.</hi> But admit, not grant, that God commanded Swearing for that end meerly: What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>It is to be conſidered,</hi> (ſayes <hi>F. H.) that this was the ſtate of minority of the Jewiſh Church, wherein God gave them Ordinances ſutable to their ſtate; but it does not follow, that theſe Ordinances were to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally binding—eſpecially ſeeing Chriſt has prohibited this about Swearing, and Propheſied, that Types and Figures ſhould ceaſe.</hi> Which is a moſt pittifull beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Queſtion; I have alwayes denyed that Oaths
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:172714:97"/> are Typicall, and he without any proof but his own bare aſſertion, takes it as granted, that they are, and uſes that as an Argument, that now they are unlawfull. So the Queſtion betwixt us is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt forbad all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or no, and he holding the affirmative, ſayes, That Gods command for Swearing was temporary, (which is falſe) and that appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt prohibits <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> So that upon the reſult of all, one of <hi>F. Hs</hi>. <hi>great and weighty Reaſons (as himſelfe</hi> termes them <hi>P.</hi> 39.) <hi>Why Chriſt forbad all Swearing,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this, becauſe he forbad
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:172714:97"/> all Swearing. Were it not out of great compaſſion to weak, and ſeduced Chriſtians, I could not have forced my ſelfe to write all this (which ſome perhaps will judge loſs of time) in refutation of ſuch irrationall Tenets.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> The ſumme of the fifth Reaſon is, <hi>That ſeeing God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Swearing meerly for the prevention of Idolatry</hi> (which fancy was refuted in the laſt <hi>Sect.) and that there is not now that Idolatry in Chriſtendome that was in the world before, and after the Flood; therefore Chriſt had Reaſon to forbid all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The weakneſs of this illation is very diſcernable.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:172714:98"/> For ſuppoſing at preſent (not granting) that God upon that ſole motive commanded Swearing, it follows, that where the Reaſon of that command ſtill remains, there the command it ſelfe is ſtill in force. But there are ſome Chriſtians that at this time either border upon, or live with Heathen Idolaters (as thoſe that dwell amongſt the Indians) who therefore by vertue of that command may lawfully Sweare. Secondly, There are that hold, that there is groſs Idolatry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the moſt parts of Chriſtendome (if not in all) to this very day, and I ſuſpect
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:172714:98"/> that <hi>F. H.</hi> may be of that Opinion, and then it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Swear by the Name of God, in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner al <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> over, becauſe it is more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Swear by God than by the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> But (3dly.) the vanity of this Argument does more fully appear, that (whatſoever may be ſaid now of the converſion of the world from Paganiſme, yet) at that time when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is pretended to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Oathes, the world was in the very ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as concerning Idolatry, that it was in, when the Law was delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> all Nations beſides the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:172714:99"/> 
               <hi>Jews,</hi> being then no leſs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of worſhipping Heathen Deities, than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And therefore if God for preventing that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did once co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (as <hi>F. H</hi> confeſſes) then <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the ſame account had Reaſon not to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it. So unhappy is <hi>F. H.</hi> in his Argumentations, that the very ſame motive which he brings in as a Reaſon why Chriſt ſhould prohibit Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is an Argument for it, being the onely ground (as he ſaves) upon which God formerly did enjoyne it. And therefore upon ſuppeſall that there is now no feare of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:172714:99"/> amongſt us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon no neceſſity of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by God; yet it was not ſo in our Saviours dayes, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were on every ſide environed with Heathens, who thereupon ſhould not (and therefore doubtleſs did not) prohibit Swearing, when there remained the very ſame cauſe for it, for which God before had commanded it. If <hi>F. H.</hi> then would expound the meaning of Chriſts words according to his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he ſhould <hi>interpret</hi> them. The time will come, when <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip</hi> ſhall ceaſe, and the <hi>Gentile World</hi> become Chriſtian, till that time you
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:172714:100"/> may as God has appointed, Swear by his Name, but then all Oathes, even that by the Name of God will become vain, and unneceſſary, and from thenceforth I charge you not to Swear at all.

And further, that famous Antiquary ſayes, <hi>The Husband</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ejuſdum libri, c. 2.</note>

For when he ſuſpected her to be too familiar with any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then he was to admoniſh her before witneſs, that ſhe ſhould not be ſhut up with that man in ſome private place; for of that admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was to make proofe in preſence of the Magiſtrate, before his Plea could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. Again, the ſuſpected party was not to be a boy of nine years old, or under, for in reſpect of ſuch, there could
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:172714:119"/> be no juſt ground for his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. And further, he was to prove by credible <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> that ſhe was found in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate with that Perſon of whom he had fore-warned her. Beſides, if he either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his proſecution, as he might if he pleaſed, or had carnall knowledge of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her being in private with the ſuſpected party, ſhe was freed from undergoing that tryall; as likewiſe ſhe was that was Married to an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite, or to a blinde man, or to a minor, or was a minor her ſelfe, or if ſhe were lame of her feet, or wanted a hand, or were dumbe, or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:172714:119"/> deafe, or were onely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, not Married; or if ſhe had been carnally known by her Husband before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or if her Husband were as culpable as her ſelfe; as <hi>Paſchaſius Ratbertus</hi> in <hi>Mat</hi> 5. ſayes, <hi>Nihil iniquius quam for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicationis causâ uxorem abjieere, &amp; ſeipſum ab eodem vitio, non cuſtodire.</hi> For in all theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhe was excuſed from thoſe bitter waters of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. And beſides all this, it was in the womans power abſolutely to decline that tryall, before the Prieſt had blotted out the curſes he had written with the bitter Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſhe was to drinke;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:172714:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> but ſo, (as alſo in ſome of the recited caſes) that ſhe was forth with to be diſmiſſed without Dower, which is an <hi>Argument,</hi> that <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> this Law of <hi>Zelotypy, there</hi> was great Reaſon that divorces ſhould be allowed in caſe of Adultery.

And the contrary aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he refutes in that place as hereticall, being the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of one <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of the impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the old Gnoſtiques. And there is much Reaſon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:172714:124"/> for the declared Judgment of that ancient Father, it being very unlikely (as the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> well argues, <hi>in locum</hi>) that <hi>Moſes,</hi> who by his own Authority would determine nothing about a temporall inheritance, but brought the cauſe of <hi>Zelophehads</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 5. would make a Law in a matter of much higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, before he had conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, and knowne his pleaſure therein.

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part, that Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> cannot be ſet in oppoſition to the Law of God, was proved in the Sermon by twelve Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereto no ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwer can poſſibly be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the contrary Tenent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtructive to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inconſiſtent with the following words, whereof

For can we imagine that he, that <hi>was the wiſedom of the Father,</hi> would not rather Preach
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:172714:156"/> what was needfull, than what was needleſs?

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:172714:158"/> in that particular had been ſo far from perfection, that it had not exceeded that of the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees.</hi> If it be ſaid, <hi>That the Law forbad ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Swearing;</hi> I confeſs it, and yet the people commonly practiſed it to bad purpoſes, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> allowed that practiſe; ſo that though there was no need of a new Law, yet there was a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a rigorous re inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the old, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the erronious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the one, and the debauched Manners of the other.

Quiver, and that is, <hi>That it is unlikely that the Jews ſhould ſo customarily make uſe of thoſe unobliging Oaths, which would have been ſo far from putting an end to Mens jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, distrusts, unſatisfactions, and inſecurities, that the very tender of ſuch had been ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and argumentative that the

Nor can an hundred gueſſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture counterballance the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of one ſingle credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble witneſs. Such a thing is very unlikely to happen; yet it may chance ſo to ſall out, ſuch a matter is very like to take effect, yet it is not certain. Of both kinds many inſtances may be produced. But what I aſſerted of the

               <hi>Jews,</hi> both <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>fraudulency,</hi> is atteſted by Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thors of indubitable credit, and therefore cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by failable ſurmiſes. Neither is there ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the falſhood of my Tenet (ſetting aſide the unqueſtionable Authority for the proof and aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) as there is for the <hi>Truth</hi> of it. For who knows not, that in every place there are ſome more ſubtile, ſome more ſimple, ſome cheaters, ſome cheatees, (as our Comedian Phraſes it) and that theſe by ſiniſter Arts, Oaths, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Piety, and many cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning practices may eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

I confeſs it is very improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſuch as knew, and conſidered the invalidity of thoſe Oaths, unleſs they were very credulous, ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be often delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereby. I neither ſay, nor think that: my Tenet ſtands well enough without it. There might be too many that made it their endeavours to beguile thoſe they dealt withall, by fallacious Oaths, or promiſes of ambiguous ſenſe, though the more wary, and cautelous people were

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> Next <hi>F.

To which I ſay, That if <hi>F. H.</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the ſame thing forty times over, I cannot help it.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:172714:171"/> The ground of all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes is, that Popiſh Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Law was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

Yet I would demand of him (if indeed it be ſo as he ſayes, <hi>That God made the Law imperfect</hi>) did he doe it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, or knowingly? To ſay he did it ignorantly, is blaſphemy; for if he be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, he is not Omniſcient, and conſequently, not God. And if he did knowingly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could not make it
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:172714:172"/> better, or he would not. To ſay he could not, is as bad as the former, for that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Omnipotency, and then he were not God (to whom nothing is impoſſible, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 37.) nor Almighty, and then the firſt Article in the Creed, and many Texts in Scripture, are altogether untrue. To ſay he would not, is worſe (if worſe can be) for that derogates from his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Word, who queſtionleſs made his Edicts, as he did his works of Creation, <hi>Very good.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange that <hi>F.

His undoubted ſenſe thereof in this place is this, and no more; My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you know what our common Saviour ſaid as touching Oaths, and how ſtrictly he forbad you the uſe of them, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> permitted you, to wit, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Creatures, and upon what account, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his you have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:172714:191"/> too much neglected, if not purpoſely for baſe ends diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. And therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you that henceforth you would be ſo carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of your duty, and ſo religiouſly obſervant of that his ſacred Precept, that you never hereafter <hi>Swear by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or Earth,</hi> or any other of thoſe <hi>Creature-Oaths</hi> which you have hither to uſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull purpoſes. So that any other Oath, is not abſolutely any other whatſoever, but any other of the like Nature as <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> any other that the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to abuſe, of which ſort that by God was not. And this may
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:172714:191"/> ſtop their mouthes, that ſay, that St. <hi>James</hi>'s Propoſition is a univerſall negative, and therefore excluſive of all manner of Oaths whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo it is no more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Swear by God, than by Heaven. For it is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, nor prohibitive of Swearing by the Name of God. For the Apoſtle neither did, nor durſt forbid what God had commanded, and what Chriſt had not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. For the former would have rendred him Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; the other Anti-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. If therefore our bleſſed Saviour did not abrogate <hi>Swearing by God,</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:172714:192" rendition="simple:additions"/> upon occaſion uſed (as I have ſhewed before that he did not, nor could, unleſs he had ſet himſelfe in oppoſition to his Heavenly Father) then it is certain alſo, that St. <hi>James</hi> did not, unleſs any dare ſay, that his Doctrine croſſed Chriſts, which could they prove, they would turne this Epiſtle out of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>res, and not ſuffer it to remain any longer in the Catalogue of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Books. For it were blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to aſſert, <hi>That Saint</hi> James, <hi>aſſiſted in his Writing by the Spirit of God,</hi> as is now generally believed) <hi>ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow what our Lord himſelfe had approved.</hi> Whereupon it
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:172714:192"/> is neceſſary to aſſert, <hi>That he went no further in this matter, then he had Chriſt for his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne.</hi> But further, (if we would make him ſpeak ſenſe) it muſt be confeſſed, that he did not forbid here all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Oaths, and namely thoſe which the Phariſees Taught to be obliging, of which kind were theſe, <hi>By the Gold of the Temple,</hi> or <hi>by the gift upon the Altar,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 16, 18. if that be true, (which <hi>F. H.</hi> affirmes, and I deny not) that they were all forbidden before, and not uſed by the people. And how can we conceive, that they uſed theſe Oaths to their
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:172714:193" rendition="simple:additions"/> fraudulent purpoſes any more, than that by God, when theſe, according to the Doctrine of their Rabbies, were as obligatory as that? And if they uſed not them, but onely ſuch as they might ſafely break without Perjury, (<hi>ſuch as by heaven, earth, &amp;c.</hi>) why ſhould S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>James</hi> ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly prohibit them <hi>above all things,</hi> unleſs he took them for greater crimes than Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Adultery, which both <hi>S.

Let then any impartiall Reader conſider, what in tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable non-ſenſe theſe men impoſe upon the Apoſtle (or rather upon the holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:172714:193"/> whoſe Penman he was) for the upholding of their own credits amongſt thoſe well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning people they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, and for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that fond Paradox they have thus long aſſerted, and are now aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. For according to them, this muſt be the Paraphraſe of his words, <hi>My brethren, I pray you above all things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare Swearing, I ſay above all things, not that it is a greater ſin then any other, but that you have gotten ſuch a cuſtome thereof. I therefore intreat you earneſtly not to Swear any more (as you uſually did) by Heaven, Earth, or any other Oath that is by

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:172714:194"/> be anſwerable to your words, that you be not juſtly condemned by God and Men, for your falſhood and couſinage.</hi> This interpretation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words (being liable to no inconveniencies, or obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that I can foreſee) will be, I am confident, in the Judgement of all knowing, and impartiall men, much preferrable before the other, which is encountered with inſuperable difficulties. And I wiſh that <hi>F. H.</hi> and thoſe of his perſwaſion, would think themſelves to be but men, and therefore ſuch as may be poſſibly deceived; and then, take what I ſay into ſerious

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:172714:207"/> Oaths:</hi> And beſide, <hi>had Christ intended any exception here</hi> (as he eaſily might ſo) <hi>he would have exprest it, as he did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately above in the caſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</hi> To the former, I refer it to the Judgement of all the world, whether the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of foure particulars (for there are no moe reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) be an amplification of a generall Prohibition, or no? For example, Thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Swear at all upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, either by God, or any thing els: Thus <hi>Christ</hi> meant, if we may credit <hi>F.

For rationally to refute an error, and modeſtly to diſſwade ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced perſons from ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwaſions, as would draw upon them both guilt, and puniſhment, is one of the beſt ſervices can be done them, and that (eſpecially where it is accompanied with civility of deportment, and offices of humanity towards them) as it cannot in Reaſon, ſo in charity it ought not to be miſ-interpreted, as a deſigne to incite thoſe that are in Authority to a further ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:172714:236"/> againſt them. God knows that I ſincerely wiſh their converſion, not their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I have not taſted ſo lightly of the bitter cup of perſecution for Conſcience ſake, <hi>that it can</hi> be any delight to me that <hi>F. H.</hi> or any other, ſhould drinke thereof upon that account. They think it hard to ſuffer for not Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Law enjoynes it. But I could tell them who ſuffered for not Swearing, (and that I trow was harder) when the Law diſallowed it. But for <hi>F. H.</hi> he does more then enough (as though he were the greateſt enemy to his brethren) to irritate his
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:172714:237"/> Superiours againſt them by frequent reproches of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrate, and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious imputations upon the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But I ſhall neither recite the words, nor quote the places, leaſt that prove the occaſion of a new complaint, unleſs <hi>F.

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:172714:237"/> me to recrimination. And for his frequent inſinuations of my being a time-ſerver, an oppoſer of Chriſts plaine words, a deceiver of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, one that ſtirs up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to the perſecution of the godly, and I know not what, I impute them either to his paſſion, and diſcontent, or els to his crafty ſeeking by theſe petty artifices, to create in his friends a bad opinion of me, that they may reape no benefit by my labors; I beſeech the Lord that theſe things may never be layd to his charge. For my ſelfe, I thanke God, I harbour no hatred in mine heart againſt
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:172714:238"/> him, or any other. I never projected the ruine, or hurt of any of them; but onely endeavoured to manifeſt to them, and the world, what I know aſſuredly, and what no rationall man upon ſerious deliberation, and peruſall of what is written on both ſides can deny to be Truth. And if in order thereto, I have ſhowed the vanity, or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludingneſs of <hi>F. Hs</hi>.
